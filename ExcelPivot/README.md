# Excel-Pivot
Quick project using the 'ExcelJS' package with templates I created to make a manual report faster.

The project iterates over the first column of data in an excel file, and based on the value found in those cells it will copy data from the second column and paste it in the appropriate month column (Jan-Dec).
